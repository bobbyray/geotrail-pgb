        <h2>Title Bar</h2>
        <p>At the top of the screen is a title describing the currently selected map view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="#helpMainMenu">Main Menu</a> is on the left and has several items
            such as Settings and Help.</li>
            <li>The Help symbol ("?") displays this Help - Guide.</li>
            <li>The View DropList on the right selects the <a href="#helpSelectMapView">Map View</a>.</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>The app starts showing the <a href="#helpOnlineMap">Online Map</a>.</p>
        <p>More details about the map views and Main Menu follow.</p>
        <h2 id="helpSelectMapView">Select Map View</h2>
        Select a view from the View droplist on the Title Bar:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#helpSignInOffBar">Sign-in/off</a> presents the Sign in/off Bar.</li>
            <li><a href="#helpOnlineMap">Online</a> lets you select a trail from ones saved on a web server.</li>
            <li><a href="#helpOfflineMap">Offline</a> lets you view trails when you are 
            not connected to the web. You need to select the trails to save to your phone when 
            you are online.</li>
            <li><a href="#helpDrawTrail">Draw a Trail</a> lets you create a new trail and save it online.</li> 
            <li><a href="#helpEditTrail">Edit a Trail</a> lets you edit a trail that 
            you have saved online.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2 id="helpSignInOffBar">Sign-in/off Bar</h2>
        <p>If you do not sign in, you can only view public trails created by others.
        However, if you sign in, you can create trails and edit your trails, which can be marked
        as Private for only you to view, or Public for anyone to view.</p>
        If you are not signed in, but need to be to complete an action such as editing, drawing, or finding
        your trails, you are automatically shown the Sign in/off Bar.
        <p>On the left side, the User name is shown when you are signed in. If you are not signed, the User name is blank. 
        You do not type in the User name box, it is filled in automatically when you sign in.</p>
        <p>The Sign-in DropList is shown on the right:
        <ul>
            <li>Select Facebook to sign in.<br/> 
            Your sign-in id is remembered so 
            you do not need to sign in again unless you log out.</li>
            <li>Select Logout to logout of Facebook.<br/>
            Note: Facebook can be tenacious about keeping you logged in. You may need to go
            to Facebook to force a logout.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2 id="helpOnlineMap">Online Map</h2>
        You can find trails that have been saved online by you or others. The trails you find are in the Trails droplist
        from which you select a trail to view. Your current geolocation on the trail is shown 
        and you can be alerted if you are off trail. When you are off trail, instructions for returning to the trail
        are shown. The beginning of the trail is indicated by a short green line and the end by a short red line. 
        Also automatic tracking can be enabled to determine if you are off trail.
        <h3>Trails DropList</h3>
        <p>Select a trail from the web that others have made public and ones
        that are private to you.</p>
        <h3>Save Offline Button</h3>
        <p>Touch the Save Offline button to save a trail you are viewing so that you can
        view it when you are offline. (See <a href="#helpOfflineMap">Offline Map</a> below.)</p>
        <h3>Find Trails DropList</h3>
        <p>Select an option from the droplist to search for trails to view.
        The Trails droplist is filled with the trails found.</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Find Trails > Home Area<br/>
            Searches for trails that are in your Home Area, which is a geo-rectangle
            defined in <a href="#helpHomeArea">Menu > Settings > Home Area</a>.
            All public trails and your private trails are included.</li>
            <li>Find Trails > On Screen<br/>
            Searches for trails that are in the area displayed on the screen. 
            First, pan, zoom, and pinch to select the area you see on the screen.</li>
            <li>Find Trails > All Trails<br>
            Searches for all public trails and your private trails.</li>
            <li>Find Trails > All Mine<br/>
            Searches for all your trails, both public and private.
            You must be signed in to search for your trails.</li>
            <li>Find Trails > My Public<br/>
            Searches for all of your public trails, trails that anyone can see.</li>
            <li>Find Trails > My Private<br/>
            Searches for your private trails, trails that only you can see.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="helpOnlineRecord">Record DropList</h3>
        You can record your travel on the map along with your travel time.
        This is useful to keep track of the time and distance for a run.
        Also recording can be helpful if you are trying to return to a trail.<br/>
        Basically you can start, stop, and resume recording a trail. The droplist shows
        the current recording state. Touching the droplist presents options
        to control recording:
        <ul>
            <li>Off State
                <ul>
                    <li>Start<br/>
                    Starts recording and enters On State.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unclear<br/>
                    Restores the recorded trail on the map that has just been cleared.
                    If there is no recorded trail to restore, Unclear is not shown.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On State
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop<br/>
                    Stops recording and enters Stopped State.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Stopped State
                <ul>
                    <li>Save Trail<br/>
                    Saves the recorded trail to the web server. If the recorded trail is 
                    new, enters the TrName State for you to enter a trail name. Otherwise
                    uploads the recorded trail to the web server and remains in the Stopped State.
                    </li>
                    <!-- Append Trail no longer used. There is insert trail in Edit mode instead
                    <li>Append Trail<br/>
                    Append Trail is only available if you can append the recorded trail
                    to the main trail currently shown. If the main trail shown is not
                    one of your trails, or if there is no main trail shown, 
                    you cannot append the recorded trail.<br/>
                    When Append Trail is available, appends the recorded trail to the
                    main trail, uploads to the server, and remains in the Stopped State.
                    -->
                    </li>

            <li>Prev Geo Loc Thres<br/>
            Number of meters of current geolocation with respect to previous location 
            for change in location to be considered valid. (This prevents small variations in the geolocation of

            <li>Spurious V Limit<br/>
            The velocity limit in meters/second for a recorded point to be spurious. 
            A point in a recorded trail may be spurious (invalid). If the velocity of point from a previous point
            is too great, the point cannot actually be in the recorded trail and can be filtered out.</li>

        <h1>Help - Back To Trail</h1>
        <p>The instructions for returning to the trail give the heading 
        to return to the nearest point on the trail from your
        current location.</p>
        <p>There are also suggestions to turn from your current traveling direction
        to go back to the trail. While the heading back to the trail is accurate,
        suggestions for turning may not be. Since a turning suggestion may be
        inaccurate, it is prefixed with a "?" mark.</p>
        <p><b>THE TURNS ARE ONLY SUGGESTIONS AND MAYBE WRONG:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One kind of suggestion (?P) is based on the heading from your previous location.
            You may not have traveled in a straight line from your previous location.</li>
            <li>The second kind of suggestion (?C) is based on the compass heading that your phone 
            may be able to provide. The compass heading is the direction your phone indicates 
            you are traveling and is most accurate when you are holding 
            your phone level with its top pointing in the direction you are traveling. 
            The compass may need to be calibrated to show accurately.<br/><br/>
            To calibrate your compass, rotate it three times or so around each axis:<br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hold the phone vertically facing you.<br/>
                    Tilt top of phone down and then back up toward you.</li>
                    <li>Rotate top of phone phone left and right keeping the face of phone towards you.</li>
                    <li>Rotate face of phone away and back toward you, keeping the phone vertical.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>        
        <p>To get an accurate turning suggestion from your previous location:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Touch MyLoc button to get your location.</li>
            <li>Walk in a straight line more than the previous geolocation threshold, typically 40 meters (44 yards).
            The Prev Geo Loc Thres is given in Menu > Settings.</li>
            <li>Touch MyLoc button again to see the off trail distance, return heading, and turning suggestion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Of course, if you know accurate compass directions yourself, follow the heading back to the trail.
        The turning suggestions are only an aid if you do not know accurate compass directions.</p>

        <p>When automatic tracking is enabled, the battery in the phone is drained more quickly.
        The shorter the interval for automatic tracking, the quicker the battery drains. 
        So make the interval longer to reduce the drain on the battery.</p>
        <p>Menu > Settings > Geo Tracking Update sets the distance interval for continuous tracking.</p>
        <p class='noIosHelp'>Menu > Settings > Geo Tracking Interval sets the time interval for periodic tracking. </p>
        <p>Menu > Settings > Allow Geo Tracking No disables automatic tracking,
        which minimizes the battery drain.</p> 
        <p>You can still check your geo location manually by touching
        the MyLoc button on the bottom of the map.
        <span class="noIosHelp"> Also, if using a Pebble watch, the Select (middle) button does the same thing.</span></p>
        <p>The Track control on the bottom of the map lets you toggle automatic tracking On or Off.</p>
        <span class="noIosHelp">
        When this app is in the background (not showing) with automatic tracking Off, the app is not draining the battery.
        However, if the app is in the background with automatic tracking On, the app is draining the battery.</p>
        <p>Note that if the phone screen is turned off (phone not powered totally off, just the screen turned off),
        automatic tracking when On
        is still occurring, which is draining the battery.</p>
        </span>
        <p class='noAndroidHelp'> 
        Automatic tracking does NOT occur if the app is in the background (not showing).</p>
        <p>When automatic tracking is Off, the drain on the battery is minimal.</p>

        <b>ADVICE FOR TURNING TO RETURN TO TRAIL MAYBE WRONG</b></p>
        <p>The heading back to the trail should be accurate, but the suggestions for turning back to the trail
        may not be.</p>
        <p>A suggestion for turning to return to the trail starts to a "?" to indicate it may be inaccurate and 
        is only a <b>SUGGESTION TO BE VERIFIED BY YOU</b>. The suggestions for turning my be wrong for various reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The heading from your previous geolocation is assumed to be a straight line, 
            but you may not have traveled in a straight line.</li>
            <li>The compass may need to be calibrated.</li>
            <li>The compass heading depends on the orientation of your phone. The compass heading (the direction you are traveling)
            is most accurate when you are holding the phone level with its top pointing in the direction you want to travel.</li>
            <li>The geolocation provided by your phone has tolerances for its accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DATA AND PRIVACY</h2>
        <h3>Server Data</h3>
        <p>For trails that you define, data is stored on a server. The data has latitude and longitude for points
        defining the trail. Your Facebook public identification (not your name) is associated with your trails.
        The data is not encrypted. Minimal protection for the database is provided through access controlled by a password.
        Be aware that data could be obtained illegally by hackers or legally by an authorized governmental authority.</p>
        <h3>Data on Your Phone</h3>
        <p>Data is saved on your phone for defining trails and caching map sections when you are offline.
        It can be deleted by you from your phone by managing the application on your phone.</p>
        <h3>Making Your Trails Public or Private</h3>
        <p>When you define a trail you mark it as Public or Private. If a trail is Public, it can be seen by anyone
        using this app. If the trail is marked Private, the trail is only visible by you when using the app.
        However, as mentioned above, the data at the server could be compromised, in which case your Private trails could be known.</p>
        <h2>A FURTHER CAUTION</h2>
        <p>Hiking depends on your own self reliance and good judgment. Realize that trails you find
        may not be appropriate for your abilities and that the trails could have inaccuracies.</p>
